# Reporting Security Issues

Thank you for wanting to help! Please use the GitHub Security Advisory 
["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/MathiasSM/dotfiles/security/advisories/new) tab.

I'll answer soon after with next steps. I use this repo myself, so it's very important to me to 
keep it up to date, free of security issues and vulnerabilities. If I'm aware of others using it as well,
then keeping it safe to use becomes even more important to me.
